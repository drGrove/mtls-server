# MTLS Server Kustomziation

The included files are the base resources necessary to run an MTLS server in kubernetes. There are a few items missing
that you will need to patch in yourself for this to actually work.

Create a kustomize folder for deployment and add the following configuration and customize for your needs.

`kustomization.yml`
```
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: mtls
resources:
  - github.com/drGrove/mtls-server/kustomize?ref=<hash>
patches:
  - update-deployment-fqdn.patch.yaml
generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true

    behavior: replace
    files:
      - files/config.ini

  - name: mtls-user-seeds
    behavior: replace
    files:
        - files/user_seeds/<other-user-key>.asc

      - op: replace
        path: "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value"
        value: "certauth.<YOUR_DOMAIN>"
```

`update-deployment-fqdn.patch.yaml`
```
apiVersion: apps/v1

  name: mtls

  template:
    spec:
      containers:

          env:
            - name: FQDN
              value: "certauth.<YOUR_DOMAIN>"
```

NOTE: If you decide to use something like [ksops][ksops] for your secret management or want to use a generator, you need
to make sure that your new secret has the following annotation:

```
â€¦
metadata:
  annotations:
    kustomize.config.k8s.io/behavior: replace
```
